Semi-supervised Reward framework (SemiReward) is designed to predict reward scores to evaluate and filter out high-quality pseudo labels, which is pluggable to mainstream Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods in wide task types and scenarios. The results and details are reported in [our paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03013). The implementations and models of **SemiReward** are based on **USB** codebase.
_**USB** is a Pytorch-based Python package for SSL. It is easy-to-use/extend, *affordable* to small groups, and comprehensive for developing and evaluating SSL algorithms. USB provides the implementation of 14 SSL algorithms based on Consistency Regularization, and 15 tasks for evaluation from CV, NLP, and Audio domain. More details can be seen in [Semi-supervised Learning](https://github.com/microsoft/Semi-supervised-learning)._

<!-- Introduction -->

## Introduction

Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has witnessed great progress with various improvements in the self-training framework with pseudo labeling. The main challenge is how to distinguish high-quality pseudo labels against the confirmation bias. However, existing pseudo-label selection strategies are limited to pre-defined schemes or complex hand-crafted policies specially designed for classification, failing to achieve high-quality labels, fast convergence, and task versatility simultaneously. To these ends, we propose a Semi-supervised Reward framework (SemiReward) that predicts reward scores to evaluate and filter out high-quality pseudo labels, which is pluggable to mainstream SSL methods in wide task types and scenarios. To mitigate confirmation bias, SemiReward is trained online in two stages with a generator model and subsampling strategy. With classification and regression tasks on 13 standard SSL benchmarks of three modalities, extensive experiments verify that SemiReward achieves significant performance gains and faster convergence speeds upon Pseudo Label, FlexMatch, and Free/SoftMatch.

<!-- News and Updates -->

## News and Updates

- [01/16/2024] SemiReward v0.2.0 has been updated and accepted by [ICLR'2024](https://openreview.net/forum?id=dnqPvUjyRI).
- [10/18/2023] SemiReward v0.1.0 has been released.

## Getting Started

First, you need to set up USB locally.
To get a local copy up, running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

USB is built on pytorch, with torchvision, torchaudio, and transformers.

To install the required packages, you can create a conda environment:

```sh
conda create --name semireward python=3.8
```

then use pip to install required packages:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

From now on, you can start use USB by typing 

```sh
python train.py --c config/usb_cv/fixmatch/fixmatch_cifar100_200_0.yaml
```

### Installation

USB provide a Python package *semilearn* of USB for users who want to start training/testing the supported SSL algorithms on their data quickly:

```sh
pip install semilearn
```

You can also develop your own SSL algorithm and evaluate it by cloning SemiReward (USB):
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Westlake-AI/SemiReward.git
```

### Prepare Datasets

The detailed instructions for downloading and processing are shown in [Dataset Download](./preprocess/). Please follow it to download datasets before running or developing algorithms.

## Usage

### Start with Docker
The following steps to train your own SemiReward model just as same with USB.

**Step1: Check your environment**

You need to properly install Docker and nvidia driver first. To use GPU in a docker container
You also need to install nvidia-docker2 ([Installation Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html#docker)).
Then, Please check your CUDA version via `nvidia-smi`

**Step2: Clone the project**

```shell
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/Semi-supervised-learning.git
```

**Step3: Build the Docker image**

Before building the image, you may modify the [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) according to your CUDA version.
The CUDA version we use is 11.6. You can change the base image tag according to [this site](https://hub.docker.com/r/nvidia/cuda/tags).
You also need to change the `--extra-index-url` according to your CUDA version in order to install the correct version of Pytorch.
You can check the url through [Pytorch website](https://pytorch.org).

Use this command to build the image

```shell
cd Semi-supervised-learning && docker build -t semilearn .
```

Job done. You can use the image you just built for your own project. Don't forget to use the argument `--gpu` when you want
to use GPU in a container.

### Training

Here is an example to train one of baselines FlexMatch on CIFAR-100 with 200 labels. Training other supported algorithms (on other datasets with different label settings) can be specified by a config file:

```sh
python train.py --c config/usb_cv/flexmatch/flexmatch_cifar100_200_0.yaml
```

Here is an example to train FlexMatch with SemiReward on CIFAR-100 with 200 labels. Training other baselines with SemiReward can be specified by a config file:

```sh
python train.py --c config/SemiReward/usb_cv/flexmatch/flexmatch_cifar100_200_0.yaml
```
You can change hyperparameters for SemiReward by configurations (.yaml files) like other baselines. If you want to change loss or something is fixed in our method for SemiReward, it is recommanded to open flie from:

```sh
semilearn/algorithms/srflexmatch/srflexmatch.py
```

**Tips:** Semireward use **4GPUs** for training by default. Also, for users in some areas of China, huggingface region locking occurs, so local pre-training weights need to be used when using the Bert and huBert models. Take the Bert model as an example, you need to focus on `./semilearn/datasets/collactors/nlp_collactor.py`, find line 102 to change it's address into your local folder for Bert. Also, in file `./semilearn/nets/bert/bert.py` line 13, it need to the same way to adjust.

### Evaluation

After training, you can check the evaluation performance on training logs, or running evaluation script:

```
python eval.py --dataset cifar100 --num_classes 100 --load_path /PATH/TO/CHECKPOINT
```
