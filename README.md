<!-- Introduction -->

## Introduction

**USB** is a Pytorch-based Python package for Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL). It is easy-to-use/extend, *affordable* to small groups, and comprehensive for developing and evaluating SSL algorithms. USB provides the implementation of 14 SSL algorithms based on Consistency Regularization, and 15 tasks for evaluation from CV, NLP, and Audio domain.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

This is an example of how to set up USB locally.
To get a local copy up, running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

USB is built on pytorch, with torchvision, torchaudio, and transformers.

To install the required packages, you can create a conda environment:

```sh
conda create --name usb python=3.8
```

then use pip to install required packages:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

From now on, you can start use USB by typing 

```sh
python train.py --c config/usb_cv/fixmatch/fixmatch_cifar100_200_0.yaml
```

### Installation

We provide a Python package *semilearn* of USB for users who want to start training/testing the supported SSL algorithms on their data quickly:

```sh
pip install semilearn
```

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Development

You can also develop your own SSL algorithm and evaluate it by cloning USB:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/Semi-supervised-learning.git
```

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>


### Prepare Datasets

The detailed instructions for downloading and processing are shown in [Dataset Download](./preprocess/). Please follow it to download datasets before running or developing algorithms.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

USB is easy to use and extend. Going through the bellowing examples will help you familiar with USB for quick use, evaluate an existing SSL algorithm on your own dataset, or developing new SSL algorithms.

### Quick Start with USB package

<!-- TODO: add quick start example and refer lighting notebook -->

Please see [Installation](#installation) to install USB first. We provide colab tutorials for:

- [Beginning example](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1lFygK31jWyTH88ktao6Ow-5nny5-B7v5)
- [Customize datasets](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1zbswPm1sM8j0fndUQOeqX2HADdYq-wOw)

### Start with Docker

**Step1: Check your environment**

You need to properly install Docker and nvidia driver first. To use GPU in a docker container
You also need to install nvidia-docker2 ([Installation Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html#docker)).
Then, Please check your CUDA version via `nvidia-smi`

**Step2: Clone the project**

```shell
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/Semi-supervised-learning.git
```

**Step3: Build the Docker image**

Before building the image, you may modify the [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) according to your CUDA version.
The CUDA version we use is 11.6. You can change the base image tag according to [this site](https://hub.docker.com/r/nvidia/cuda/tags).
You also need to change the `--extra-index-url` according to your CUDA version in order to install the correct version of Pytorch.
You can check the url through [Pytorch website](https://pytorch.org).

Use this command to build the image

```shell
cd Semi-supervised-learning && docker build -t semilearn .
```

Job done. You can use the image you just built for your own project. Don't forget to use the argument `--gpu` when you want
to use GPU in a container.

### Training

Here is an example to train one of baselines FlexMatch on CIFAR-100 with 200 labels. Training other supported algorithms (on other datasets with different label settings) can be specified by a config file:

```sh
python train.py --c config/usb_cv/flexmatch/flexmatch_cifar100_200_0.yaml
```

Here is an example to train FlexMatch with SemiReward on CIFAR-100 with 200 labels. Training other supported algorithms (on other datasets with different label settings) can be specified by a config file:

```sh
python train.py --c config/SemiReward/usb_cv/flexmatch/flexmatch_cifar100_200_0.yaml
```
If you want to change some hyperparameters for SemiReward, you can open flie from:

```sh
semilearn/algorithms/srflexmatch/srflexmatch.py
```

### Evaluation

After training, you can check the evaluation performance on training logs, or running evaluation script:

```
python eval.py --dataset cifar100 --num_classes 100 --load_path /PATH/TO/CHECKPOINT
```

### Develop

Check the developing documentation for creating your own SSL algorithm!
